# Players Logic



This document outlines the logic for managing players within a game session.

## Listing Players

- The application provides a way to list the players currently participating in a game session.
- This is typically triggered by an action, such as clicking a "List Players" button.
- When invoked, the application fetches player information from Redis. Redis is used as a temporary data store to hold real-time information about players in a session.
- The data in Redis is stored under a key that matches the game session ID (`sessionId`). The expected data structure is a JSON object where:
    - Keys: User IDs (strings).
    - Values: The user's current score (number). This structure is used for storing player scores and leaderboards. It's important to note that this might not be the complete picture of player-related data in Redis, as it might also include other information like player nicknames.

## Removing Players (Currently Incomplete)

-   The application initially had functionality to allow the removal of players from a session.
-   This was represented in the UI by a trash icon next to each player's name in the player list.
-   However, this functionality was not working correctly and has been temporarily removed from the user interface.
-   The underlying logic (which is not currently used) involved:
    1.  Identifying the player to be removed (likely by their user ID).
    2.  Updating the player list stored in Redis by removing the entry for the specified player.
    3.  Handling potential errors during the Redis update.
-   The removal of the UI element does not necessarily mean the complete removal of the underlying logic in the code. It's possible that parts of the player removal logic still exist but are not currently being used.
